# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This is a classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking the grid with "X" or "O", and the first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all grid spaces are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows two players to compete against each other.
- **Interactive UI**: The user interface updates in real-time as players make their moves.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner when three marks are aligned.
- **Draw Condition**: Recognizes and handles the draw condition when all grid cells are filled and no winner is found.
- **Game Reset**: Players can reset the game board to play again after a win or draw.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic, updating the game board, and checking for winning or draw conditions.

## How It Works

1. **Player Turns**: The game starts with Player 1 (X) and alternates between Player 1 and Player 2 (O).
2. **Win Detection**: As players make their moves, the game checks for a winning combination (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
3. **Draw Detection**: If all grid spaces are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
4. **Reset**: After a game concludes, players can reset the board and start a new game.
